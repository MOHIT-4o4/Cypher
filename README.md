# Cypher
Text Encryption and Decryption
Module Used : Fernet , pyttsx3

Encryption:   Encryption is the process of encoding the data. i.e converting plain text into ciphertext. This conversion is done with a key called an encryption key.


Decryption:   Decryption is a process of decoding the encoded data. Converting the ciphertext into plain text. This process requires a key that we used for encryption.
We require a key for encryption


Pyttsx3 :   pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
